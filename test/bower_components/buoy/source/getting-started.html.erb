    <h1>Getting Started</h1>
    <p>While every component has a particular scss file, all styleguide related scss files are compiled into one master file <code>style.css</code>. This represents all patterns, mixins, variables, and component styles.</p>

    <p>Buoy also includes javascript, which is responsible for some components such as chosen-select boxes and patterns such as modals or input float labels. This javascript is included in the ruby gem.</p>

    <h2>Setting Up in Rails</h2>
    <p></p>

    <h2>Style Overrides</h2>
    <p>CSS only goes in Buoy if it's reusable. On some occassions it'll make sense to create custom styles for your project. Where these styles are stored depends on what you're using to build your app.</p>
    <h3>Some Guidelines</h3>
    <ul class="u-mb-5">
      <li>Load your app's custom styles after loading Buoy, or they might be overridden.</li>
      <li>Use Buoy when possible. Use <%= link_to "utility classes", sg_utilities_path %> for spacing. Don't create new CSS you don't need.</li>
      <li>Use BEM. If you're creating a custom button, create a new class within your app called <code>Button--modifier</code>.</li>
      <li>Never use IDs as styling hooks. Those are for JS and links.</li>
      <li>Optimize for less specificity. Instead of <code>div.Box</code>, do <code>.Box</code></li>
      <li>Avoid nesting. Instead of <code>.Box .Button</code> do <code>.Button</code></li>
    </ul>
